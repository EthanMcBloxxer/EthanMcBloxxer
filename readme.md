## I'm EthanMcBloxxer.

I have experience in...

* HTML/CSS/JS/jQuery
* C#
* C++
* Lua/LuaU (Roblox Lua)
* Object Notations (JSON, YAML, XPath, CSV)
* QBasic

I like contributing anonymously, but also getting credit for what I do. I don't like screwing anything up or wasting anyone's time. I also don't really know what I'm doing on GitHub, even with 1+ year of being here.

***Quick Admonition:** Check out [my Gists](https://gist.github.com/EthanMcBloxxer)! There's tons more code there that might be useful to some people. Take them into account when thinking about this as my portfolio!*

I've made 2 websites before, one of which is now [hosted on my GitHub profile page](https://ethanmcbloxxer.github.io/old/ethansware/index.html). My current one is at [ethanmcbloxxer.github.io](https://ethanmcbloxxer.github.io/), and has posts/documents at [/published](https://ethanmcbloxxer.github.io/published/).

Under Roblox, I made things like clothing stores, utilities, CLIs, skill showcases, and API users. Additionally, I attempted [creating an exploit](https://github.com/EthanMcBloxxer/BloxsploitWF) with the WeAreDevs and EasyExploit APIs, but Bitdefender deleted it in my sleep and I got unmotivated to recover it. During my motivation period, though, I wrote a few LuaU exploits that are now [available in the form of Gists](https://gist.github.com/search?l=Lua&q=user%3AEthanMcBloxxer).
