  ### The Name
  I heard that "Bloxxer" was actually a term for "Killer" on Roblox (online gaming platform). After I learned you could use their FMOD (Unity-like) editor to create games with Lua, I decided to base my name off of it. Even better, there were exploits out there that helped me learn C# and want to learn C++. That's a pretty decent turning point from when I first started learning QBasic and HTML. What would I base my name off of there? EthanQB? Basiq? What would that even mean?

  ### The Logo
  My friends continuously tell me that this is a bad logo, but I don't really think I could make anything better (or at least don't have ideas for anything better). It takes inspiration from the Awesome Face meme.

I've made 2 websites before, one of which is now [hosted on my GitHub profile page](https://ethanmcbloxxer.github.io/ethansware/index.html). My current one is at [ethanmcbloxxer.github.io](https://ethanmcbloxxer.github.io/) and using [the Beautiful Jekyll theme](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll).

I also made about 6 Roblox games, but only 1 of them was an actual game. The others are things like clothing stores, utilities, CLIs, skill showcases, and API users.

On the topic of Roblox, I attempted [creating an exploit](https://github.com/EthanMcBloxxer/BloxsploitWF) with the WeAreDevs and EasyExploit APIs, but Bitdefender deleted it in my sleep and I got unmotivated to recover it. During my motivation period, though, I wrote [a few LuaU exploits](https://ethanmcbloxxer.github.io/pastebin#roexploits) on my website.

I like contributing anonymously, but also getting credit for what I do. I don't like screwing anything up or wasting anyone's time. I also don't really know what I'm doing on GitHub, even with 1+ year of being here.

You can find my other socials (and ways to contact me) on [ethanmcbloxxer.github.io](https://ethanmcbloxxer.github.io/), or email me at <EthanMcBloxxer@pm.me>.
